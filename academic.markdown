# Early
I was graduated at No.2 high school attached to eastern china university.
During my early academic education, I was strong at Math, Physics, English, 
Essay writing and Information Technology. My weakest subjects are History and
Biology. 

I was part of training camp for Mathematics Olympics. I got first prize in
 Chinese Mathmatics League and got admitted to Peking University, exempted
 from college entrance exam. See intro below:
