# Carnegie Mellon University (2015 Summer)
Research Intern supervised by Dr. Jonathan Aldrich

Project: Module System for Architectural Control
*  Designed a module system based on Wyvern Programming Language to enforce the 
architectural behavior by integrating the descriptions directly into the program
*  Impelmented parser, translater and type checker to support the module system
*  Presented poster in 2015 summer intern summit
*  Related Skills: Programming Languages, Software Engineering, Java


# Peking University (2014-2016)
Research Assistant at Programming Languages Lab, supervised by Dr. Yingfei Xiong

Project: Dynamic Mutation Analysis
*  Developed a novel model of mutation analysis that analyzed mutants during the
 execution of program and forked the execution only when a mutant led to a new system
 state
*  Implemented the instrumentation to support the dynamic mutation analysis on top
 of LLVM IR layer
*  Presented in Peking Universities undergraduate research summit
*  Related Skills: Software Testing, Software Engineering, Dynamic Analysis, LLVM, 
 C++
