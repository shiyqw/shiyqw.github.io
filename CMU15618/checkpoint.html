Checkpoint summary
The general goal of our project is to implement a lock-free concurrent hashmap in C++. In the TA's feedback, we are encouraged to complemete more work rather than simply implementing a single hashmap data structure. Now we modified our goals a bit. In this project, we will implement lock-free concurrent hashmap in C++ with different collision resolution method and evaluate their performance. In specific, we are trying to implement our lock-free concurrent hashmap with linear probing, leapfrog probing (http://preshing.com/20160314/leapfrog-probing/) and cuckoo hashing. If still have free time, we will try to extend our implementations on more collision resolution methods.  


Completed work
As scheduled, the first week we will focus on background study and decide the base implementation method. We've read several related work. The followings is the list of the materials we have read.

After discussion we decided to use the method from XX as our base implementation. 

We recieved our feedback on the first days of the second week. We discussed several available extension of our works and we decided to focus our extension on different collision resolution methods. We researched on several different collision resolution methods and decided to choose linear probing, leapfrog probing and cuckoo hashing as our goal functions. 

We also started the base implementation of XX. We re-implemented the Java's according to the rules. This work is still going on.


Prelimary result

Recently we did not have any prelimary results as the base implementation is still going on and has some bugs. We plan to finish the implementation by this weekend and move our work onto GitHub. 

Revised schedule
Before May 1st
Before May 8th
Before May 10th
Before May 12th

Concern

We mainly have two concerns:
(1) We are still finding Benchmark we are competeing with. We recently find XXX. It includes a implementation of lock-free concorruent hashmap. We recently decided to use it as our benchmark competitor. 

(2) We are still finding test data for our implementation and we have NOT found yet. We will appreciate if some resource can be provided!
