# Google (2018-)

## Team: Personalized Service Health
A GCP tool that provides fast, transparent, relevant and actionable communication
about Google Cloud service disruptions 
[[official page](https://cloud.google.com/service-health)]

Role: Software Engineer III (2023-03 to current)

**Notification Workflow for Scheduled Maintenance (Ongoing Project)**
*  Design and implement the processing system in a parallel and distributed model
*  Design and implement the consumer APIs for viewing all maintenances
*  Co-lead the private preview launch
*  Related skills: GCP, Distributed System, Parallel Computing, Cloud API, Golang

## Team: Virtual Testing
A high-fidelity simulated production environment for development and release
integration testing built on top of Google Compute Engine (Virtual Machine). 
This is an internal testbed.

Role: Site Reliability Engineer III (2019-11 to 2023-03)<br>
Role: Software Engineer II (2018-04 to 2019-11)

**Simulating Production Environment in VM-based Cluster**
*  Onboarded multiple Google Production services to VM-based test environments.
 This unblocked the critical path for testing turnup for cloud region.
 The services onboarded including:
    *  Spanner: A distributed SQL database management and storage service
    *  _Name redacted_: A remote debug logging system
    *  _Name redacted_: A dynamic data push system
    *  _Name redacted_: A package management system
*  Related skills: Virtualization, Production, Database, Distributed System,
 Containerized Development, C++, Python, Shell, Golang, Logging

**Coverage Analysis for Turnup Tests**
*  Defined RPC-based test coverage metric in cloud turnup tests for test quality
 evaluation
*  Defined workflow-based test coverage metric in cloud turnup tests for test
 fidelity evaluation
*  Designed and implemented instrumentation method for collecting coverage in
 the test
*  Created dashboards to visualize the coverage data
*  Related skills: Software Testing, Distributed Systems, Monitoring, 
 Visualization, Bazel, Python, Dynamic Analysis

**CPU Overcommit for Turnup Tests**
*  Enabled CPU overcommit in VM-based turnup tests and saved CPU cost for ~50%
*  Created dashboards and SLOs to monitor the performance and reliability
*  Designed automatic fallback mechanisms during resource shortage to ensure
 the performance and reliability of the test tool
*  Optimized the resource usage efficiency by avoiding fragmentations using
 smarter bin-packing strategy
*  Prevented resource contention by applying pessimistic concurrency
*  Related skills: Cloud API, Advanced Algorithms, Monitoring, Parallel Computing,
 Distributed Systems, Python

**Cluster Lifecycle Automation in Virtualized Environments**
*  Designed and implemented an automated workflow to bootstrap all the
 dependencies of a test environment
*  Designed and implemented a tool to update multiple package versions acrosss
 all VMs in a cluster statelessly
*  Implemented tools to create, snapshot and delete a test cluster
*  Related skills: Distributed System, Automation, Version Control, Linux, 
 Python, Golang, Shell

**Other work (operational, community)**
*  Participate in oncall rotation, following Google's SRE [best practice](
 https://sre.google/sre-book/part-III-practices/)
*  Hosted intern at summer 2022
*  Conduct interviews frequently (10+ interviews per year)
*  Led several rounds of bug fix weeks and product excellence reviews

# Amazon (2017)
Team: Customer Service Technology

Intern Project: Guided Workflow Card - New Model and Storage
*  Initiated a new model of guided workflow card (a tool used by Amazon customer
 service agent during phone calls) to support contextual representation
*  Simplified the configuration format. The new model is ~30% length of the old
 model
*  Migrate the backend to a different storage service (_Name redacted_)
*  Implemented the end-to-end authorization workflow for creating a new card
  configuration, from configuring the model to storage
*  Related Skills: AWS, UI design, Database, Java
